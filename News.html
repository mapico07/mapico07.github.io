            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ed Sheeran faced two notable copyright cases related to his music:</h2>
            <p>“Shape of You” vs. “Oh Why”: In 2022, Ed Sheeran won a High Court battle over his 2017 hit “Shape of You.” Grime artist Sami Chokri (performing as Sami Switch) had claimed that the “Oh I” hook in Sheeran’s track was too similar to an “Oh why” refrain in his own song “Oh Why.” However, the judge ruled that Sheeran had not plagiarized Chokri’s 2015 track, emphasizing that similarities between songs are common due to limited musical notes and chords.</p>
            <p>“Thinking Out Loud” vs. “Let’s Get It On”: In another case, Ed Sheeran faced allegations that his Grammy-winning song “Thinking Out Loud” copied elements from Marvin Gaye’s classic “Let’s Get It On.” However, a Manhattan jury found no willful copyright infringement, and Sheeran was cleared of the accusations.</p>
