            <p>“Thinking Out Loud” is a romantic ballad by Ed Sheeran. It was released as the third single from his second studio album, “×” (pronounced “multiply”), on 24 September 20141. The song was written by Ed Sheeran and Welsh singer-songwriter Amy Wadge, and it was produced by Sheeran’s frequent collaborator, Jake Gosling.
                The song is known for its heartfelt lyrics, which speak of a lifelong love that persists even as physical youth fades. Sheeran was just 23 years old when he wrote the song, yet he imagines a love that lasts into his older years. The lyrics express a commitment to love someone even when physical attributes change with age, highlighting the enduring nature of true love.
                “Thinking Out Loud” achieved significant commercial success and critical acclaim. It resonated deeply with fans around the world, becoming a popular choice for weddings and romantic occasions. Notably, it was the first song to spend a full year in the UK Top 40 and the first to reach 500 million streams on Spotify, where it was also named the top “first dance” song globally.
                The music video, which features Sheeran performing a ballroom dance, further popularized the song. It’s worth mentioning that Sheeran learned to dance specifically for the video, showcasing his dedication to the artistry of the song.
                The song’s melody and harmonies draw inspiration from classic soul music, and live performances of “Thinking Out Loud” often include nods to Marvin Gaye’s “Let’s Get It On”, reflecting its influence on Sheeran’s work</p>
