            <p> Edward Christopher Sheeran, known professionally as Ed Sheeran, was born on February 17, 1991, in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England. Raised in Framlingham, Suffolk, he began writing songs at the tender age of eleven. His musical journey gained momentum when he independently released the extended play No. 5 Collaborations Project in early 2011. This caught the attention of industry heavyweights like Elton John and Jamie Foxx. Later that year, Sheeran signed with Asylum Records.
                His debut album, + (“Plus”), was released in September 2011 and soared to the top of the UK Albums Chart. It featured his breakout hit single, “The A Team”. Sheeran’s second studio album, × (“Multiply”), achieved global success upon its release in June 2014. It became the second-best-selling album worldwide in 2015. The album’s single, “Thinking Out Loud”, earned him Grammy Awards for Song of the Year and Best Pop Solo Performance in 2016.
                In March 2017, Sheeran released his third album, ÷ (“Divide”), which became the best-selling album worldwide that year. The singles “Shape of You” and “Castle on the Hill” broke records by debuting in the top two positions on charts in several countries. He even made history by having two songs debut in the US top 10 in the same week.
                Sheeran continued his success with his fourth album, No.6 Collaborations Project, released in 2019. It debuted at number one in major markets and spawned three UK number one singles: “I Don’t Care”, “Beautiful People”, and “Take Me Back to London”. His fifth studio album, = (“Equals”), topped charts in most major markets in 2021. And recently, his sixth album, - (“Subtract”), was released on May 5, 2023, followed by his seventh album, Autumn Variations, under his own record label, Gingerbread Man Records
